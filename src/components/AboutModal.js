            My name is Oleg Nosyrev, I also go by Logan Nosyrev. Logan as my

            I am a self-taught Front End Developer with{' '}
            <strong>4+ of professional</strong> and{' '}
            <strong>9+ years of personal development</strong> experience. I
            accrued certificates from Harvard and University of Washington and
            my first degree is an Associate's Degree in Culinary Arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            While my culinary education may not seem immediately relevant, it
            has instilled in me a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a
            passion for creative problem-solvingâ€”qualities that I believe are
            transferable and valuable in software engineering.
          </p>
          <p>

            I'm highly motivated, attention-to-detail-focused, organized, a
            quick learner and a great communicator in both personal and
            professional settings.
          </p>
